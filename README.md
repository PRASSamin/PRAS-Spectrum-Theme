# Nykro Theme (Formerly PRAS Spectrum Theme)

> ***
> ### Final Note
>
> This theme pack started as nothing more than a scrappy dream. I was still new, still learning, and just wanted to make something that *felt right* for my eyes colors that I could vibe with, something personal, something mine.
>
> Back then, I even had big plans to build a full-blown experience: huge custom file and folder icons bundled in... it was wild. But now? Life moved on. Priorities shifted. I no longer have the time or energy to maintain that side of the project.
>
> So in this update, Iâ€™ve officially **removed the icon support** to cut down package size and maintenance. If youâ€™re looking for great icons, I highly recommend switching to [**Material Icon Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) this is the best icon theme for VS Code.
>
> The **themes**, though? They're still here.
> And they're still exactly what I use.
> In fact, the **PRAS Dark Abyss** theme has been my daily ride-or-die since the very beginning. I made it for myself, and it still hits the same. ðŸ–¤
>
> This might be the last update this repo ever gets.
